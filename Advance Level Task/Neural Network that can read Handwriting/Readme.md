In this Project We have to develop a neural network that can read Handwriting.
The Dataset used in this Project is MNIST Dataset.
MNIST is a commonly used dataset in machine learning and computer vision research, which consists of a set of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9), each of size 28x28 pixels. The dataset is split into two sets: a training set of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images. The training set is used to train a machine learning model, while the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance.
