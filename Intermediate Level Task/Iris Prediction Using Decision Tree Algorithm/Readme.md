# About the Dataset
The Dataset used in this Project is Iris Flower Dataset which is taken from kaggle.This Dataset contains features of different flower species. Independent features in this dataset are Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width. All these lengths were in centimeters. And Dependent feature, which will be the output for the model, is Species. It contains the name of the species to which that particular flower with those measurements belongs.In this Project we will build the Decision Tree Algorithm model for making prediction of Iris Flowers and then we will evaluate the model and plot the tree.
